# Intent Outreach

**AI outbound prospecting for founders who do their own selling — research → enrich → outreach, in
Claude Code, with your own model.**

Intent Outreach is a model-agnostic, Claude-Code-native SDR orchestrator. It researches companies,
enriches the leads, and drafts personalized outreach — running **fully on your machine**, with **your
own** data-provider and model keys, and **zero Google dependency**. Claude is the default model;
**OpenAI (gpt-4o) is eval-gated in** — bring an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and it just works. Grok / Gemini
adapters ship ready and gate in the same way once an eval run with a real key passes.

As a Claude Code plugin, an **orchestrator skill** (`/intent-outreach`) dispatches **phase sub-agents**
(research → enrich → draft) over a **bundled MCP server** that houses your data-provider APIs — keeping
each phase in its own context while the orchestrator checkpoints with you between stages.

> Built for technical founders / indie SaaS & AI startups who do their own outbound — no SDR
> headcount, no per-seat data tools, you own your keys and your data.

## Why it's different

- **Local-only.** Runs on your machine. No hosted database, no telemetry, no server-side retention.
  Run records go to a local JSONL file (`~/.intent-outreach/runs.jsonl`).
- **BYO keys.** Connector + model keys live in your environment (or supported local configuration). They're read
  locally and sent only to each provider's own API — never to us, never to a cloud secret store.
- **Deterministic where it matters.** Connectors are called in a fixed order in code; the model is
  called only at two seams (fit-scoring, drafting). The LLM never decides which API to hit.
- **A real data model + a hard gate.** Every record is a validated value type. Un-validated model
  output **cannot** reach storage — it's a compile error, and a CI invariant.
- **Model-agnostic, but earned.** A provider is "supported" only after it passes golden evals. No
  silent-quality surprises from a weak model dropping a tool call.
- **Pluggable connectors.** Ships adapters for Apollo, Hunter, People Data Labs, Exa, Crunchbase,
  LeadMagic, Clay, Clearbit, and ZoomInfo — and a registry so you can add your own in one file.
- **Vertical packs + a compliance gate.** A pack composes a fail-closed compliance gate (DNC, TCPA
  quiet hours, service area) with versioned prompts over the same engine; blocked contacts are
  recorded, never drafted. `b2b-sdr` ships as the default.

## Two ways to run it

### 1. Claude Code plugin (primary)

```text
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/intent-outreach
/plugin install intent-outreach@jeremylongshore
```

Then invoke the skill (`/intent-outreach`) with an ICP and some domains. The skill drives the bundled
**Intent Outreach MCP server** through deterministic Research → Enrich → Outreach phases, checkpoints
with you between each, drafts grounded messages, and saves a **validated** run locally.

The plugin also ships:

- **Phase sub-agents** — the orchestrator skill dispatches one per stage via the `Agent` tool:
  `outreach-researcher` (Phase 1, one per domain — fan-out), `outreach-enricher` (Phase 2),
  `outreach-drafter` (Phase 3, grounded score + draft). Each keeps its own context and calls only the
  deterministic MCP tools for its stage; the orchestrator aggregates and checkpoints with you.
- **Companion skills (slash commands)** — `/outreach-connectors` (which data connectors are
  configured), `/outreach-research` (quick Phase-1-only research without a full campaign),
  `/outreach-profile` (inspect or scaffold a Report Profile). Each is a focused, user-invocable skill.
- **A `SessionStart` hook** that prints a one-line connector-readiness status.

### 2. Standalone CLI

```bash
npm install                    # only needed to develop/regenerate; the bundle is committed
node bundle/cli.mjs run --icp "B2B SaaS founders doing their own outbound" \
                        --domains acme.com,globex.com --channel email
node bundle/cli.mjs connectors   # which connectors are configured
node bundle/cli.mjs providers    # model providers + eval-gate status
```

`bundle/cli.mjs` and `bundle/server.mjs` are committed, dependency-inlined builds (so the plugin runs
on a fresh clone with no `node_modules`); regenerate them with `npm run bundle`.

## Keys (bring your own)

Set only the providers you want; unset connectors are skipped. Provider access, pricing, and quotas
change independently, so use `/outreach-connectors` for the repository's current runtime notes and
confirm commercial terms with the provider before a campaign.

| `CLAY_API_KEY` + `CLAY_WEBHOOK_URL` | Clay — middleware (push-only)                            | paid             |
| `CLEARBIT_API_KEY`                  | Clearbit — enrichment                                    | registry: legacy |
| `ZOOMINFO_JWT`                      | ZoomInfo — enrichment                                    | enterprise       |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                 | Claude (default model, eval-gated ✓)                     | —                |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                    | OpenAI gpt-4o (eval-gated ✓ 2026-08-20)                  | —                |
| `XAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY`    | Grok / Gemini (adapters ready; gate pending an eval run) | —                |

To drive a non-Anthropic model from inside Claude Code, point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at an LLM gateway
(LiteLLM/Bifrost). See `000-docs/017-AT-DECR`.

- **`pipeline_core/`** — the framework-free spine (CI-guarded against any Google/cloud import).
- **`mcp/server.ts`** — one stdio MCP server, thin wrapper over `pipeline_core`.
- **`skills/intent-outreach/SKILL.md`** — the orchestrator skill; dispatches phase agents in fixed order.
- **`skills/outreach-{connectors,research,profile}/`** — focused companion skills (the slash commands).
- **`agents/`** — phase sub-agents (`outreach-researcher`, `outreach-enricher`, `outreach-drafter`).
- **`hooks/`** — `SessionStart` connector-readiness hook.
- **`prompts/`** — versioned, eval-gated prompt files.
- **`evals/`** — golden fixtures + scorers; the supported-provider gate.
- **`profiles/`** — Report Profile schema and starters. The skill path automatically maps channel,
  score threshold, contacts-per-lead, and style; renderer and delivery helpers are separate APIs.
