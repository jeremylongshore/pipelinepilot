/**
 * pipeline_core/connectors/clearbit.ts — Clearbit (legacy) connector.
 *
 * NOTE: Clearbit was acquired by HubSpot in 2023 and folded into HubSpot Breeze
 * Intelligence. New API keys are no longer issued. This connector works only with
 * an existing compatible credential; availability is controlled by the provider.
 *
 * Endpoints (Clearbit v2, auth via Authorization: Bearer <key>):
 *   - Person lookup:  GET https://person.clearbit.com/v2/people/find?email=<email>
 *   - Company lookup: GET https://company.clearbit.com/v2/companies/find?domain=<domain>
 *
 * Clearbit is asynchronous for new lookups — the person endpoint may return HTTP 202
 * (Accepted) with an empty or non-JSON body while it fetches data in the background.
 * We treat a 202 or an empty/non-object body as "no data this call" and skip rather
 * than throw. Results appear synchronously on subsequent calls once Clearbit has
 * cached the lookup.
