/**
 * pipeline_core/connectors/types.ts — the connector contract.
 *
 * "Wire it for anything and everything": a connector is one adapter implementing
 * this interface. The deterministic pipeline iterates configured connectors in a
 * fixed order (registry insertion order) and calls them — the LLM never chooses
 * which connector runs. A connector with no key self-skips (isConfigured() ===
 * false), so absent keys are silent skips, never errors.
 *
 * Adding a provider = write an adapter here + register it in ./index.ts. Users
 * can register their own at runtime via registerConnector() — no core edits.
